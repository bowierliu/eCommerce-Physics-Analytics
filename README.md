# eCommerce-Physics-Analytics

## Project Overview
This project explores how principles from physics can be applied to e-commerce analytics to uncover actionable insights. By leveraging models such as interaction force, energy flow, and oscillatory behavior, this analysis provides a novel perspective on customer behavior, product performance, and revenue optimization.

## Physics-Inspired Applications
1. **Customer-Product Interaction Force**  
   - Formula: **F = (G × m₁ × m₂) / r²**  
   - Measures the "attraction" between customers and products based on spending, revenue, and recency.  

2. **Energy Flow in Transactions**  
   - Formula: **E = Quantity × Amount**  
   - Quantifies the total monetary "energy" exchanged in transactions.  

3. **Momentum of Products and Customers**  
   - Formula: **p = m × v**  
   - Reflects the inertia of sales growth for products and customers.  

4. **Frictional Loss in Customer Retention**  
   - Formula: **F(t) = F₀ × e⁻ᵘᵗ**  
   - Highlights customers at risk of churn based on declining engagement.  

5. **Oscillatory Behavior in Purchases**  
   - Formula: **x(t) = A × sin(ωt + ϕ)**  
   - Identifies recurring purchase patterns to align marketing strategies.

## Dataset Description
The analysis was conducted on a merged dataset of e-commerce transactions, combining two sources:
- **Amazon Sales Report**: Contains order-level details such as SKUs, quantities, amounts, and transaction dates.  
- **International Sales Report**: Captures global sales with customer information, gross amounts, and product details.

## Features
- **Customer Insights**: Identify high-value customers and at-risk segments.  
- **Product Performance**: Highlight key revenue-driving and emerging products.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Detect recurring purchase patterns and seasonal trends.

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations for:
- Interaction forces between customers and products.
- Energy flow contributions by products and customers.
- Momentum of top-performing products and customers.
- Frictional loss for at-risk customer segments.
- Oscillatory behavior in purchases over time.
